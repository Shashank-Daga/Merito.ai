Video job descriptions (JDs) are a relatively new tool in the recruitment arsenal, but they're quickly gaining popularity. According to a survey by Software Advice, 60% of job seekers said they would be more likely to apply for a job if the job description included a video.
<br />

So, what makes video JDs so effective in attracting and engaging with prospective talent? Here are a few reasons:
<br />

**They showcase company culture**

One of the biggest advantages of video JDs is that they allow companies to showcase their company culture. By showing what it's like to work at the company, job seekers can get a better sense of whether they would be a good fit. This can help attract candidates who are aligned with the company's values and culture and reduce turnover rates down the line.
<br />

**They provide a better understanding of the role**

Video JDs can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role, beyond what can be conveyed in a written job description. For example, a video could include interviews with current employees who hold the same position, explaining what their day-to-day responsibilities are, what skills are required to succeed, and what challenges they face. This can help candidates determine whether they have the necessary qualifications and experience and whether the role is a good fit for their career goals.
<br />

**They make the company stand out**

In today's highly competitive job market, companies need to find ways to stand out from the crowd. Video JDs can help accomplish this by showing off the company's brand and personality. They allow the company to differentiate itself from competitors and demonstrate what makes it unique. This can be especially effective for companies with a strong visual identity or a distinctive culture.
<br />

**They can be more engaging than written job descriptions**

Video JDs are inherently more engaging than written job descriptions. They can be visually appealing, include music and sound effects, and use a variety of storytelling techniques to capture the viewer's attention. This can help candidates stay focused and interested in the job opportunity, which can lead to more applications and a higher quality of candidates.
<br />

**They can be shared on social media**

Finally, video JDs can be easily shared on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. This can help increase visibility and reach a wider audience of job seekers who may not have otherwise come across the job posting. In addition, social media sharing can help create buzz around the company and job opportunities, which can further enhance the company's employer brand.
<br />

In conclusion, video JDs can be a highly effective tool for attracting and engaging with prospective talent. Learn how Merito can help you attract more qualified candidates and reduce turnover rates in the long run by using video JDs.
