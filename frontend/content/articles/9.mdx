7 in 10 women in India take a career break- some without a choice and some to address their familial needs at the moment. This phenomenon of women taking a career break, although a global issue, holds unique implications in India. According to McKinsey’s report, The power of parity, the contribution of women to India’s GDP is only 18 percent, one of the lowest in the world. 
<br />

The societal expectation that often compels women to take career breaks has significant implications for India's economy.The same McKinsey report also estimates that gender diversity in the workforce could add $770 billion to India's GDP by 2025. 
<br />

Making women equal at the workplace already has many layers of complexities, including but not limited to pay gap, maternity break, bias against professionalism, sponsorship and non-existent paternity leave. According to a survey, women held only 15 percent of senior and middle management positions in India in 2020. To improve this ratio, we need to support women who wish to return to the workforce after a career break- they understand how to work in teams, understand personalities and navigate tight deadlines and high-pressure situations.
<br />

Many organizations in India are actively seeking to hire women returning from a career break. Creating a successful returnee program for women in organizations involves detailed planning and a commitment. Women on a career break don’t show less motivation; in fact, many crave a return to paid employment. The biggest obstacle they face is imposter syndrome. We, at Merito, help our clients set up a successful returnee program by following these key steps:
<br />

# ***1. Understand the ‘Why’ behind the program:*** Why do you wish to run this program? Is it because you want to improve the diversity? Is it because you think it’s a moral imperative under DEI initiatives? Or is it because you feel that this is the untapped talent pool which if harnessed correctly, will benefit the company?
<br />

# ***2. Program Design:*** Many organizations usually start with a cohort of returnees, with rigorous training & intervention. After the training period, depending on various factors, returnees are converted to full time employees. Some go for direct hires, where returnees are hired as full time employees from the beginning.
<br />

# ***3. Awareness and Training:*** Once you know the above two, it’s important to align everyone in the organization by conducting workshops and training sessions on unconscious bias and gender sensitivity. Foster a supportive work culture that values diversity and inclusion.
<br />

# ***4. Dedicated Returnee Program Team:*** Establish a dedicated team or department responsible for designing, implementing, and overseeing the returnee program. This team should include HR professionals, mentors, and program coordinators who are well-versed in the unique needs of returning professionals.
<br />

# ***5. Resource Allocation:*** Allocate sufficient resources, including budget and personnel, to sustain the program over the long term. Recognize that the initial investment may yield substantial returns in terms of talent acquisition and diversity. 
<br />

# ***6. Flexible Work Arrangements:*** Recognize that women returning to work may have varying needs when it comes to working hours and location. Offer flexible work arrangements, including part-time, remote, or flexible scheduling options, to accommodate their family responsibilities while ensuring productivity. 
<br />

# ***7. Structured Career Plan:*** Help returnees set clear career goals and create development plans to achieve them. Regularly review progress and provide feedback to ensure they are on track. Offer skill enhancement programs or training courses as required.
<br />

# ***8. Mentorship and Sponsorship:*** Establishing mentorship and sponsorship programs that connect women on career breaks with senior leaders within the organization can provide crucial guidance and support.
<br />

# ***9. Metrics for Success:*** Define clear metrics for success. These could include the number of returnees hired, their job satisfaction, retention rate, and their contributions to the organization.
<br />

# ***10. Feedback Loops:*** Establish regular feedback loops with returnees to gather insights on their experiences, challenges, and suggestions for program improvement. Act on this feedback to enhance and promote the program. This will encourage more women to consider returning to work.
<br />

# ***11. Networking & Collaboration:*** Encourage returnees to network with colleagues and industry peers. Hosting networking events, seminars, or conferences can help them rebuild their professional network. Partner with external organizations, such as women's networks, industry associations, and nonprofits, to tap into additional resources and expertise for supporting returnees.
<br />

# ***12. Counselling when needed:*** Along with reskilling, organizations also need to look at the softer aspect of working with returnees. Returning to work, especially after a maternity break is often a complex transition for many women. It is accompanied by different forms of guilt like separation or work commitment guilt. Addressing this will go a long way in enabling them give their best.
<br />

Return-to-work program sends a powerful signal to employees at all life stages that the company recognizes that careers need not be linear and normalizes the idea that women may leave for a time for personal reasons. As pointed out by Pattie Sellers, ‘Careers are jungle gyms, not ladders’. Ladders have no provision of stopping and only the ones at the top have the view of everyone below. Jungle gyms provide great views for most people and you can stop and resume elsewhere. Women need not feel under pressure for losing out a few years in their career.
<br />

Companies that prioritize such initiatives tend to outperform their peers in innovation and profitability. Ultimately, investing in returnee programs is an investment in the future of the organization. It is only when women are encouraged and supported to pursue careers, India can truly achieve her full potential. India incorporation understands this and hence the spike in returnees programs. In the public domain, passing of the parliamentary bill, ‘Nari Shakti Vandan Abhiniyam’ is a step in this direction.
