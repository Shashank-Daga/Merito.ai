# Building a Solid Foundation: Strategies to Prevent Post-Joining Drop-Outs

The first few months of employment are critical for long-term employee retention. Post-joining drop-outs—employees who leave within the first 6-12 months—represent significant costs to organizations in terms of recruitment, training, and lost productivity. This comprehensive guide explores proven strategies to build a solid foundation that prevents early turnover and fosters lasting employee commitment.

## Understanding Post-Joining Drop-Outs

Post-joining drop-outs occur when new hires leave shortly after starting their roles, often due to unmet expectations, poor onboarding experiences, or cultural misalignment.
