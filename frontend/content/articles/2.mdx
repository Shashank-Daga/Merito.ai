***Recruiter:*** Good morning, Ashish! This is Sara from Merito and I came across your CV for the role of Sales Head that's I'm hiring for. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time.
<br />

***Candidate:*** Hi Sara. No, it's fine. How can I help you?
<br />

***Recruiter:*** Ashish, I must say, your experience and skills are quite impressive. However, I couldn't help but notice that there aren't many quantifiable achievements or numbers mentioned.
<br />

***Candidate:*** Oh, I see. Yeah, I've always believed that the qualitative aspects of my work speak louder than numbers.
<br />

***Recruiter:*** I completely get where you're coming from, Ashish. And I agree, qualitative aspects are crucial, but let me give you a different perspective. In the role of a Sales Head, numbers are like the heartbeat of your achievements. They not only showcase your successes but also provide tangible evidence of your capabilities.
<br />

***Candidate:*** Hmm, I hadn't thought of it that way.
<br />

***Recruiter:*** Think about it, Ashish. When we're looking for a Sales Head, we're not just interested in knowing that you've managed a team or closed deals. We want to see the impact you've had. How much revenue did you generate? What was the percentage increase in sales under your leadership? These numbers help us gauge your effectiveness and potential contributions to our organization.
<br />

***Candidate:*** I suppose you're right. Numbers do provide a clearer picture of one's accomplishments.
<br />

***Recruiter:*** Exactly. It's not just about boasting figures; it's about demonstrating your ability to drive results and make a significant impact. By quantifying your achievements, you're not only making your resume more compelling but also giving yourself a competitive edge in the job market.
<br />

***Candidate:*** Alright, Sara. You've made a compelling argument. I'll make sure to update my resume with quantifiable achievements and send it over to you as soon as possible.
<br />

***Recruiter:*** That's great to hear, Ashish! I'm confident that with your experience and now with quantifiable data to back it up, you'll be an even stronger candidate. Looking forward to seeing the updated resume. Thank you for your cooperation.
<br />

***Candidate:*** Thank you for your guidance, Sara. I'll speak to you soon.

We’ve had this conversation many times with the candidates and still do almost on a daily basis. There are hundreds of resources available online, both paid and free, on how to craft a compelling CV; and yet many of us miss the point.  
<br />

This newsletter is one for the candidates, who are looking for a change. We are not going to get into the details of why having a well-crafted CV is crucial for standing out from the crowd and securing that dream job. What we’re going to do instead is tell you how CVs get shortlisted. 
<br />

Recruiters have a vast pool of data - be it their internal data or any portals. Their first job is to select a few candidates from each of these sources to make the process more manageable for themselves. And to select the right candidates, they use filters.
<br />

**Filter One: Keywords**<br />
Each Job Description (JD) comes with a lot of keywords around what the candidate is supposed to do and what she’s supposed to have done to be qualified for the job. Recruiters pick keywords from the JDs and from their discussions with the hiring managers. These keywords help them filter the right candidates. Each ATS and job portal has filtering options to assist recruiters.
<br />

**Filter Two: Experience**<br />
Experience can have multiple filters such as number of years of experience, previous companies, job titles, team handling, the skills you’ve acquired & impact you’ve created in the past. Each of these help filter out candidates which may not be relevant for the job. You do not have much control over here as some companies have specific requirement for years of experience and previous companies worked for.
<br />

**Filter Three: Academics**<br /> 
Despite the increasing emphasis on skills and experience in the hiring process, many companies still adhere to the practice of filtering out candidates based on the colleges they attended. While it's widely acknowledged that skills and competencies are far more indicative of an individual's potential contribution to a role, the prestige associated with certain institutions continues to hold sway in the corporate world.
<br />

You don’t need to beat yourself up for the criterion out of your control; however you can still gain a competitive edge by using the right keywords, correct verbs and impactful numbers. Here’s how you do it-
<br />

**Key Elements of a Successful CV**<br />
A successful CV contains several key elements that allow it to effectively showcase your qualifications. These include a clear structure, concise information, and a focus on relevant skills and experiences. A well-organised CV allows employers to easily navigate through the document and quickly identify your suitability for the position.
<br />

**Personal Information and Contact Details**<br />
The first section of your CV should include your personal information and contact details. This should include your full name, contact number, email address, and professional social media profiles, if relevant. Ensure that this information is clear and easily accessible, allowing potential employers to contact you without any hassle.
<br />
When providing your contact details, it's important to consider the impression you want to make. Choose a professional email address that consists of your name rather than a nickname or a casual handle. Additionally, include a link to your LinkedIn profile if you have one, as it can provide employers with a more comprehensive view of your professional background.
<br />


**Summary**<br />
It is crucial to include a professional summary or objective statement at the beginning of your CV. This section provides a brief overview of your career goals, skills, and qualifications, capturing the attention of the employer and enticing them to read further. Keep the summary crisp. Nobody wants to read a one page long summary. They will just jump to experience section. 
<br />


**Work Experience and Skills**<br />
The work experience and skills section of your CV should detail your relevant work history and highlight the skills you have acquired throughout your career. List your previous job positions, with the latest one at the top, including the company names, job titles, years of employment, and key responsibilities.
<br />

When describing your work experience, go beyond simply listing your job responsibilities. Emphasize any achievements or accomplishments that demonstrate your capabilities. Use the XYZ framework to emphasize on the outcome of your job.
<br />

Provide specific examples of projects you have worked on, challenges you have overcome, and results you have achieved. This will give potential employers a better understanding of your capabilities and the value you can bring to their organization.
<br />

Highlight any skills that are relevant to the job you are applying for. This may include technical skills, soft skills, or specific industry certifications. Be sure to provide examples of how you have applied these skills in previous roles, showcasing your ability to contribute to the potential employer's organization.
<br />

**Education and Qualifications**<br />
This should list your academic achievements, including the institutions you attended, the degrees or certifications you obtained, and any relevant coursework or research projects. Highlight any honors or awards you received during your academic journey.
<br />
When listing your educational background, consider including additional details that can help you stand out. For example, mention any extracurricular activities or leadership roles you held during your time in school/college. These experiences can demonstrate your ability to manage responsibilities, work in teams, and take initiative.
<br />
Remember, the goal of your CV is to present a comprehensive picture of your qualifications and experiences. By including detailed information about your personal information, education, qualifications, work experience, and skills, you can create a CV that stands out and captures the attention of potential employers.
<br />

**Enhancing Your CV: Expert Tips**<br />
Now that you have a solid foundation, let's explore some expert tips for enhancing your CV even further. These tips will help you stand out from the competition and make a lasting impression on potential employers.
<br />
When it comes to crafting a standout CV, there are several strategies you can employ to make it more compelling and tailored to the job you are applying for. Let's delve into some of these strategies in detail:
<br />


# ***Tailoring Your CV to the Job***
One of the most crucial aspects of CV writing is tailoring it to the specific job you are applying for. Take the time to analyze the job description and understand the skills and qualifications sought by the employer. Then, adapt your CV to highlight your most relevant experiences, skills, and achievements that align with the job requirements. This customization shows employers that you have taken the initiative to understand their needs and are the perfect fit for the role.
<br />
For example, if you are applying for a marketing position, emphasize your experience in developing successful marketing campaigns, analyzing market trends, and utilizing various digital marketing tools. By aligning your CV with the specific requirements of the job, you increase your chances of catching the attention of potential employers.
<br />

# ***Using Action Verbs and Power Words***
An often overlooked aspect of CV writing is the use of action verbs and power words. Rather than passive language, such as "responsible for" or "involved in," opt for strong action verbs that convey your accomplishments and impact. Words like "achieved," "implemented," and "led" highlight your proactive approach and leave a lasting impression on potential employers.
<br />
For example, instead of saying "responsible for managing a team," you can say "led a team of 10 professionals, resulting in a 20% increase in productivity." This not only showcases your leadership skills but also quantifies your achievements, making them more impactful and memorable.
<br />
By incorporating these expert tips into your CV, you can elevate it to the next level and increase your chances of securing your dream job. Remember, a well-crafted and tailored CV is your ticket to standing out in a competitive job market and making a positive impression on potential employers.
<br />

**Common CV Mistakes to Avoid**
<br />
Let's discuss some common CV mistakes to avoid, as these can significantly impact your chances of success.
<br />

# ***Spelling and Grammar Errors***<br />
Spelling and grammar errors are a red flag to potential employers, signalling a lack of attention to detail. Ensure that you thoroughly proofread your CV and, if possible, have someone else review it for you. This extra step will help you catch any mistakes and present a polished CV.
<br />

# ***Inconsistent Formatting***<br />
Consistency is essential when it comes to formatting your CV. Ensure that font styles, sizes, and formatting are consistent throughout the document. Inconsistencies can make your CV appear unprofessional and distract the reader from focusing on the competition.
<br />

# ***Including Irrelevant Information***<br />
it is vital to include information that is relevant to the job you are applying for. Avoid including irrelevant experiences, hobbies, or personal information that does not contribute to your qualifications. The real estate is crucial in CV, use it wisely. Keeping your CV focused and concise ensures that employers can quickly identify your strengths and suitability for the position. A very long CV will dilute the impact.
<br />


A well-crafted CV is your passport to job opportunities. By understanding the importance of a well-structured CV, mastering the essential components, and incorporating expert tips, you can create a CV that stands out and increases your chances of success. Remember to tailor your CV to each job application, highlight relevant skills and experiences, and maintain consistency in formatting. By avoiding common CV mistakes, such as spelling errors and including irrelevant information, you can present yourself as a qualified and dedicated candidate. Good luck in your CV writing journey!
