# New Trends in Corporate Learning – Bringing Learning in the Flow of Work

The traditional model of corporate learning—formal classroom training and annual compliance courses—is rapidly evolving. Modern organizations are embracing "learning in the flow of work," where development happens naturally during daily activities. This shift recognizes that the most effective learning occurs when it's contextual, timely, and directly applicable to current challenges.

## The Evolution of Corporate Learning

### From Formal to Informal Learning
Traditional corporate learning focused on structured, scheduled training sessions. While valuable, this approach often felt disconnected from daily work realities. The new paradigm integrates learning directly into workflows, making it more accessible and relevant.
