#### About Lighthouse Communities
Lighthouse Communities Foundation (LCF) is a nonprofit, providing life skills, employment, and entrepreneurship opportunities to disadvantaged youth across India via PPP since 2015. Founded in Pune, it has helped thousands of youths get jobs and live life with dignity. LCF's success in Pune led to invitations for expansion to other parts of the country. Today they are present in four states, impacting thousands of urban poor and building replicable models to benefit the developing world.

#### Goal
The expansion and operating model meant they needed to hire people fast. "Any project is 50x more difficult and 100x more fulfilling in a non-profit. Especially for hiring, the biggest challenge we face is matching passion for work with skill set. It's very difficult to find both in a person", says Anuja Kishore, Chief Corporate Development Officer at Lighthouse.
That's when they decided to take the unusual route of getting a recruitment agency on board.

#### Solution
Merito compensated for its lack of experience in social sector hiring with a strong sense of empathy. Recruiters visited the center head of one location to understand their work and screen candidates accordingly for other locations. Personality played an important role in shortlisting candidates, so we looked for candidates who were problem solvers, passionate
and versatile.
It was a challenge the entire Merito team loved working on. We closed 13 positions for LCF for its Pune, Delhi, and Orissa centers across roles such as:

Center-In-Charge
Center Heads
Communication Executive
MEL Executive
Manager-Research (M&E)
Manager-Learning & Development
Skilling Manager
TA Lead
