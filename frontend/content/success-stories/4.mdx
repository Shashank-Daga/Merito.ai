Carrot is a rewards-first discovery and engagement app exclusively for D2C brands and their consumers. High-intent shoppers are surprised and rewarded for browsing, shopping, and interacting with brands on Carrot. These rewards unlock in tiers & at the highest tier, the consumer is accorded the SuperFan status.

### Mission – critical priority
Driven by the need to build a new and advanced shopping experience platform leveraging the new age technologies like Web3 and Tokenization, the client is looking to build their tech, product, and design teams.
We started hiring for Carrot when they were in the early stage of their 1 to 10 journey. What they were building was in constant flux and their web presence was very minimal.

### How Merito Helped
Through Merito’s structured targeting, it helped create awareness among candidates about the client and the position offered. This helped the client in attracting and hiring quality talent. We made sure the prospective employee can see and relate to the vision of Carrot.
<br />
By taking the bottoms-up approach, Merito hired junior roles first specifically for design-specific roles.
A different approach was taken for tech and product functions by identifying the lead roles first and thereon building a stronger team with quality talent.

### Merito’s Impact
Working with Merito, Carrot has been able to accelerate its growth by hiring for roles including but not limited to:
- **CTO**
- **Lead Developers**
- **Product Manager**
- **Product Growth**
- **Product Designer**
- **Graphic Designer**
